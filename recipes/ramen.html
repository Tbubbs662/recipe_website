    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Love noodle soup? Then you’ll want my recipe for a flavourful, restaurant-style homemade Japanese shoyu ramen! 
        This delightful chicken ramen soup broth is so jam-packed with umami goodness that you’ll want the whole pot to yourself. 
        I like to serve it with my homemade chashu pork belly, but you can add any protein of your choice. For a clear broth, 
        be sure to use a gentle simmer and scoop off any froth throughout the cooking.

        <li><a href="soy_eggs.html">Boiled Eggs</a>, to serve</li>
        <li>12 cups of Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tare(seasoning sauce)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 Cup Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Mirin</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 390°F.</li>
        <li>
            Cut the chicken wings through their joints into smaller pieces. Spread the wings and carrots out in a large roasting tin and
            cook for 45-60 minutes in the oven or until golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the roasting tin to your stovetop. Turn the heat to high and when the roasting juices in the tin start to bubble,
            add in 2 cups of water. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up all the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Then transfer all
            the chicken, carrots, and the liquid into a large stock pot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the stock pot over a high heat and add kombu, shiitake, 6 spring onions, garlic, ginger and soy sauce. Top up with 10
            cups of water. Bring the stock to a simmer then reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for 3 hours, skimming the surface 
            every so often.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the meantime, make the tare by mixing the ingredients in a small bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove and reserve the shiitake mushrooms. Remove and discard the chicken and aromatics. Strain the broth through a fine mesh
            sieve. Pour the broth into a clean saucepan. Taste and season with the tare according your taste.
        </li>
    </ol>
